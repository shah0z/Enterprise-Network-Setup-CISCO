DHCP also known as Dynamic Routing Protocol is the feature that allows a router to assign dynamic addresses to any end points that conencts to it. Hence, no more timid static ip setup.

! Exclude the gateway address from being assigned by DHCP
Router(config)# ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.10.1
Router(config)# ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.20.1

! Configure the DHCP pool for the IT VLAN
Router(config)# ip dhcp pool IT_VLAN
Router(dhcp-config)# network 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0
Router(dhcp-config)# default-router 192.168.10.1
Router(dhcp-config)# exit

! Configure the DHCP pool for the HR VLAN
Router(config)# ip dhcp pool HR_VLAN
Router(dhcp-config)# network 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0
Router(dhcp-config)# default-router 192.168.20.1
Router(dhcp-config)# exit

! Add additional DHCP pools for other VLANs (e.g., 30, 99)
